**Objective**
The objective of this project is to design an interactive Hospital Management Dashboard using Power BI that provides a 
comprehensive overview of hospital operations and financial performance.
The dashboard aims to help hospital management and stakeholders monitor patient demographics, doctor availability, 
billing status, and payment trends in order to support data-driven decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and enhance financial control.

"To build a Power BI dashboard that analyzes hospital patient data, doctor specialization, and billing performance to support operational and financial decision-making."


**Summary Report – Hospital Management Dashboard**

This Hospital Management Dashboard provides a consolidated view of key hospital metrics, enabling quick and effective analysis of both clinical and financial data.

The dashboard highlights:

Total Patients and Average Patient Age, offering insights into patient demographics and case mix.

Total Doctors, allowing management to assess resource availability and specialization coverage.

Total Bill Amount, along with Paid Amount and Pending Amount, to track hospital revenue and outstanding payments.

Analysis of Doctor Specialization vs Patient Load, helping identify high-demand specialties and optimize doctor allocation.

Payment Mode Analysis (Cash, Card, Online, Insurance, etc.) to understand patient payment behavior and improve billing and collection strategies.
Overall, the dashboard enables hospital administrators to:

Monitor financial health and reduce pending payments

Optimize doctor utilization across specializations

Gain insights into patient trends and demographics

Improve transparency and operational planning

This project demonstrates the effective use of Power BI for healthcare analytics, combining data modeling, visualization, 
and business insight generation to support informed decision-making.

"Developed an interactive hospital management dashboard analyzing patient demographics, doctor availability, billing amounts, payment modes, and pending dues, providing actionable insights for 
hospital administration."
